# hQuestMaster

hQuestMaster is an alternative (FREE) web app to the official app of HeroQuest, to play homebrew quest with an automated Zargon!

Being a Web App, theorically can run on any modern browser (Desktop, Tablet or Mobile) but later i will also release an ad-hoc App for Android and iOS.

I started working with Heroscribe maps but then after a good talking with the creator of hQuestBuilder (u/squidgem0nster) i implemented import of HQB maps and developed a kind of language to create automations for the maps events (like when entering a room, or stepping on a tile, or killing a monster, ecc..) called QuestDown, that need to be written inside the Note of the map.

Wrtiting with this syntax is possible the create automations for any Mark sign put in the map (like Arrow, Letters o Numbers); From defining a starting point, to events to be played when entering a room or on the death of a monster!
This system was a big improvment the one that i previosly used (additional xml definitions), because is more flexible ad adaptable for homebrew maps!
So i went for a full support of maps created with hQuestBuilder, and doing this, for now, the support of maps made HeroScribe (.xml) is broken (maps are loaded, but there is no support for automations at the moment), i will work on it later.


Anyone can create their own quest and play it with hQuestMaster!

Here is some early documentation on how a quest should be written with the QuestDown language:
